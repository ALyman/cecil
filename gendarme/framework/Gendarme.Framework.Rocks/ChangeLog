	class.

	* AssemblyRocks.cs: New. Extension methods for Cecil's 
	AssemblyDefinition class.
	* CustomAttributeRocks.cs: Add ContainsAny method that checks if 
	any of the specified attributes are present in the collection.
	* MethodRocks.cs: Replace IsCompilerGenerated by the more general
	IsGeneratedCode, which check for two similar attributes and also 
	checks if the type was generated.
	* TypeRocks.cs: Add GetFinalizer to return the type finalizer (if 
	any). Add IsGeneratedCode (similar to MethodRocks). Change 
	HasAttribute to work on a TypeReference (instead of TypeDefinition)
