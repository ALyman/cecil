WARNING: This ISN'T the version of permview that is currently bundled in Mono
1.1.x. This version is more complete but relies on Mono.Cecil assembly to get
the declarative security informations from the assemblies.

Differences with the current bundled version
* supports the /decl option to get declarative security informations on all
class/methods inside an assembly;
* isn't specific to the Mono runtime (no internal calls are used);
* requires Mono.Cecil.dll;

This version of permview will eventually replace the current (bundled) 
version once Mono.Cecil.dll is released with Mono.
